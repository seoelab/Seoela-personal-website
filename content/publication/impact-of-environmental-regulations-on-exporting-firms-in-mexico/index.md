abstract: In recent years, air pollution from industrial sources in Mexico has
  declined significantly despite rising output. This paper investigates the role
  of environmental regulations in driving these trends and examines their
  effects on firm-level export performance. A decomposition of the decline in
  emissions reveals that the technique effect played a significant role,
  indicating substantial improvements in pollution abatement practices within
  industries. Reduced-form estimates show that environmental regulations lowered
  pollution emissions by 15\%. Stricter regulations also reduce export entry by
  0.3\%, increase export exit by 2\%, and reduce export sales by 13\% on
  average. The impacts are heterogeneous across firms. Smaller firms face
  disproportionate compliance costs, leading to higher exit rates and larger
  revenue declines, whereas larger firms exhibit resilience, with export growth
  reflecting scale advantages and resource reallocation. Using data from 2005 to
  2014, counterfactual analysis within a quantitative model confirms that
  environmental regulations were the primary driver of the observed emission
  reductions and that the implicit price of pollution faced by firms increased
  substantially over the period.
