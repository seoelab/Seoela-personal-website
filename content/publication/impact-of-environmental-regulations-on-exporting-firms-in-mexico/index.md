  How do industry-specific environmental policies aimed at reducing emissions
  affect ex-

  porting firms? Do these policies lead to substitution of pollution-intensive goods? In this

  study, I examine the effect of Mexicoâ€™s air quality standards on the export behavior of

  firms in the manufacturing sector. These regulations, driven by environmental sustain-

  ability concerns, have raised debates regarding their economic implications, particularly in

  international trade.
