abstract: In recent years, air pollution from industrial sources in Mexico has
  declined significantly even as manufacturing output has continued to rise.
  This paper investigates the role of environmental regulations as a primary
  driver behind these trends. In particular, I examine how Mexico's ProAire
  regulations contributed to the cleanup of manufacturing and shaped firm export
  performance. A decomposition of the decline in emissions suggests that the
  technique effect played a significant role, indicating substantial
  improvements in pollution abatement practices within industries. Reduced-form
  results confirm that ProAire regulations led to a 15% reduction in reported
  firm emissions. I also find that, on average, stricter regulations reduce
  export entry by 0.3%, increase export exit by 2%, and reduce export sales by
  13%. However, the results reveal pronounced heterogeneity in the impact of
  regulation. I find that smaller firms, burdened by disproportionate compliance
  costs, exhibit a higher propensity to exit export markets and suffer
  substantial declines in export revenues. In contrast, larger firms demonstrate
  resilience, with evidence of export growth that likely reflects scale
  advantages and resource reallocation under stricter regulation. The findings
  suggest that ProAire led to significant environmental improvements and
  restructured the export margin through the reallocation of export activity
  toward larger firms.
