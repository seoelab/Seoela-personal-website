abstract: "Can environmental regulation reduce emissions without weakening
  export performance? This paper examines firm-level responses to sub-national
  air quality policies in Mexico. Between 2005 and 2014, manufacturing output
  rose while emissions declined sharply. A decomposition of these
  trends  indicates that the majority of this decline stems from the technique
  effect, reflecting improved pollution abatement. Using detailed panel data and
  variation in policy implementation across municipalities, I show that
  regulations reduced firm-level emissions by 15% on average. However, these
  gains came with tradeoffs. Stricter regulations reduced export entry by 0.3%,
  increased exit by 2%, and lowered export sales by 13%. Effects are
  heterogeneous: smaller firms faced larger compliance burdens and higher exit
  rates, while larger firms exhibited relative resilience. To interpret these
  findings, I use a multi-sector general equilibrium model with endogenous
  abatement and technology choice. Counterfactual simulations show that
  environmental regulation was the primary driver of emission reductions, with a
  substantial increase in firms’ implicit pollution price over the period."
