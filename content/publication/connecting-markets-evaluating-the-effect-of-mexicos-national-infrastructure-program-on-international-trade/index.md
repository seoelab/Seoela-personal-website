abstract: This study investigates the effects of large-scale road infrastructure
  investments on firm-level export behavior in Mexico. Between 2012 and 2020,
  the Mexican government implemented an ambitious National Infrastructure
  Program that substantially expanded the national highway network. Using
  detailed data on the location and implementation timelines of road projects,
  this paper seeks to assess how reductions in domestic trade frictions
  influence firmsâ€™ export decisions along both intensive and extensive margins.
  The analysis also explores how improved road access affects the choice of
  shipment methods and the associated implications for trade costs and pricing
  strategies. The empirical approach combines firm-level customs data,
  establishment characteristics, and geospatial infrastructure maps to construct
  measures of market access and logistical connectivity. Identification relies
  on plausibly exogenous variation in exposure to completed infrastructure
  projects over time. This research aims to contribute to the literature on
  trade and economic geography by illustrating the micro-level mechanisms
  through which transportation infrastructure shapes export performance and firm
  behavior.
