abstract: The Common Monetary Area (CMA) agreement has effectively granted the
  South African government sole discretion over monetary policy and
  implementation in the region. The effectiveness of this arrangement has long
  been under discussion given the heterogeneity of member countries. This paper
  uses a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) to examine the efficacy of the
  interest rate channel in the CMA. Specifically, our analysis uses data from
  2000M1-2018M12 to examine how economic output, inflation, money supply,
  domestic credit, and lending rate spread for each member country respond to
  shocks in the South African repo rate. The main findings indicate that a
  positive shock to the South African repo rate has a statistically significant
  negative impact on economic output and a positive effect on inflation at the
  10 percent level for all countries in the CMA. The results also show that
  money supply, domestic credit, and lending rate spread respond asymmetrically
  across members countries.
