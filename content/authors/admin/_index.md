## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in Economics at Indiana University. My research focuses on the intersection of international trade, energy economics, and environmental economics, with a secondary concentration in computational macroeconomics. I study how globalization and the environment interact through trade, infrastructure, and energy and environmental regulation, and I evaluate their broader economic and societal consequences. I also maintain an interest in housing markets, particularly the determinants of spatial variation in home prices. Prior to beginning my doctoral studies, I served as a labor economist at the Idaho Department of Labor.
