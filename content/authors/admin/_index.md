Welcome to my webpage!

I am a second-year Economics Ph.D. student at Indiana University, with a focus on applied macroeconomics and labor economics. Prior to pursuing my Ph.D., I had the opportunity to work as a labor economist for the Idaho Department of Labor, where I gained valuable insights into the real-world applications of economic principles.

My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree from the College of Idaho. Subsequently, I obtained a Master's degree in economics from Boise State University.

I am deeply passionate about researching and unraveling complex economic phenomena that impact society on a large scale. As a curious and driven individual, I continually seek to contribute to the advancement of economic knowledge, both in academia and beyond.

This webpage serves as a platform for sharing my research findings, academic accomplishments, and insights into the world of economics. I invite you to explore the different sections to learn more about my research interests, publications, and professional experiences.

Feel free to connect with me if you share similar research interests or have any inquiries. Thank you for visiting my webpage, and I look forward to engaging with you on various economic topics!
