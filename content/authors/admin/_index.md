Greetings!

I am a second-year Economics Ph.D. student at Indiana University, focusing on applied macroeconomics, international economics, and econometrics. Prior to my Ph.D., I worked as a labor economist at the Idaho Department of Labor, gaining valuable real-world insights. My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree from the College of Idaho, followed by a Master's degree in economics from Boise State University.

My passion lies in researching and comprehending significant economic phenomena to push the boundaries of economic knowledge within academia and beyond

Thank you for visiting my page!
