Greetings!

I am currently a second-year Economics Ph.D. candidate at Indiana University, specializing in applied macroeconomics, international economics, and econometrics. Prior to embarking on my doctoral studies, I held a position as a labor economist at the Idaho Department of Labor, where I had the opportunity to acquire valuable practical insights into labor market dynamics. My academic background includes a Bachelor's degree in physics from the College of Idaho and a Master's degree in economics from Boise State University.
