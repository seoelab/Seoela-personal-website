summary: This study examines the influence of existing housing inventory on home
  prices in Idaho, considering other confounding factors. Idaho's housing market
  has experienced a significant price surge over the past three years, raising
  concerns about the state's economic future. The analysis, based on a Spatial
  Durbin Model of 49 cities from 2011 to 2020, reveals a statistically
  significant relationship between housing inventory and prices. A 1% decrease
  in inventory leads to a 0.5% rise in prices the following year. Moreover,
  spillover effects indicate neighboring cities experience a 0.45% price
  increase one year after a 1% inventory decline in a given city. Policy
  implications suggest supply-side strategies to address the soaring housing
  market, including diversifying and increasing housing supply, particularly
  entry-level homes for Millennials.
