  This study explores the relationship between existing housing inventory and
  home prices in Idaho, considering the implications for the state's economy.
  While the housing market is viewed as a crucial economic indicator, the recent
  surge in Idaho's housing market prices warrants examination. The average value
  of single-family homes has risen by 173% since Q3 2011, compared to 80%
  nationally. While migration and housing supply have been discussed, this
  research delves into the significance of existing housing inventory, an
  understudied factor.


  Using a Spatial Durbin Model (SDM) and data from 2011 to 2020, the study confirms a significant link between existing housing inventory and home prices. The findings suggest that the housing market boom is primarily driven by declining inventory rather than population or income growth. A 1% decrease in housing inventory results in a 0.5% rise in home prices in the subsequent year. Spillover effects are observed, with neighboring cities experiencing a 0.45% increase in prices after a 1% inventory decline in a given city.


  The report identifies reduced homeowner and renter mobility as the primary cause of declining housing inventory in Idaho. Consequently, addressing the state's housing market prices requires supply-side strategies, with a focus on increasing and diversifying housing supply, particularly in cities most affected, including the production of entry-level homes for the growing Millennial market.
