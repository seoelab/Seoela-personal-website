title: Idahoâ€™s Center of Population Continues Westward Shift
date: 2023-07-31T17:10:53.448Z
summary: The U.S. Census Bureau regularly calculates the center of population to
  visualize population changes over time. In 1920, Idaho's center of population
  was in Custer County, but it has since shifted westward. By 2020, with a
  population of 1,839,106, the center was located in Boise County, 15 miles west
  of Stanley and 64 miles northeast of Boise. The shift indicates that a
  significant portion of Idaho's population growth is concentrated in the
  western region, where approximately 50% of the state's population increase
  over the past century has occurred. Understanding this migration pattern helps
  to comprehend the changing demographics and trends in Idaho's population
  distribution.
